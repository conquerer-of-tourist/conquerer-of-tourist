## Hi there 👋

I'm Hengsheng, a student at BASIS Independent Bellevue. (he/him)

## About + Repositories
I currently attend BIBV in WA State. I'm an AIME qualifier and USACO Silver competitor. A couple of my programming projects are listed below:
- `conquerer-of-tourist.github.io` is my personal website.
- `bibvnewspaper.github.io` is the website for my school newspaper.

I'm also working on educational projects for solutions and carefully tailored explanations for USACO that walk you through data structures and algorithms. 
I'm aiming to make a complete set of write-ups that allow you to think about the intuition of solving problems and the thinking process before going into solutions.

More information about what I do can by found on my personal website, listed above.
