# ReadME: `conquerer-of-tourist`
## Hi there 👋

I'm Hengsheng, a student at BASIS Independent Bellevue. (he/him)

## About + Repositories
I currently attend BIBV in WA State. I'm an AIME qualifier and USACO Silver competitor. A couple of my programming projects are listed below:
- `conquerer-of-tourist.github.io` is my personal website.
- `bibvnewspaper.github.io` is the website for my school newspaper.

I'm also working on educational projects for solutions and carefully tailored explanations for USACO that walk you through data structures and algorithms. 
I'm aiming to make a complete set of write-ups that allow you to think about the intuition of solving problems and the thinking process before going into solutions.

More information about what I do can by found on my personal website, listed above.
* `The Radical Statement` Ethical implications about moral decisions we make in daily life, as well as some humor!
* `Project: Minimalistic` A locally run basic HTML,CSS,JAVA project featuring minimalistic and modern timers, cubing stopwatches, an more!
* In the future, I might add a beta (and more nice-looking) combo of AoPS FTW and MathDash. (Basically, Mathcounts Trainer, but more interactive and $10000%$ times better)
* `The Tour Guide` To Conquer The Tourist: A handbook for competitive programming algorithms with solutions and explanations I wrote myself.
* Right now, it features topics like Binary Search, Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees), and in the future will contain more advanced topics such as ternary search, convex hull, advanced DFS, BFS, versions of Dynamic Programming including Knapsack, Basic Prefixes, etc.
